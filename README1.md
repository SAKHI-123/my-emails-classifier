# MagicSlides Email Classifier

This is the submission for the Full-Stack Engineer Intern Assignment for MagicSlides.app.

##  Known Blockers and Status

The application's code is structurally complete but is currently blocked from end-to-end execution due to the following dependencies:

1.  **OpenAI API Key Inactive (External Blocker):** The core email classification function is disabled due to a **Quota Exceeded** error, as the required initial credit purchase failed due to an external payment/banking issue.
